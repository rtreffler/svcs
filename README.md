# What is this?

Project I did as a part of [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org) course [Kotlin Basics](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18).

It's a simple version control system, where commited files are kept as a whole in storage dir.

It implements Strategy pattern to handle different commands by separate command implementations. 

# How to run
When imported into IntelliJ IDEA it should just work. If not, Build -> Rebuild project.

# Comment
Any comments, pull requests, issue tickets appreciated. I'm particularly interested in build improvement and tests.
